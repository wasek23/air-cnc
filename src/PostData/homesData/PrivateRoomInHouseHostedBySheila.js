		You’ll find cancellation details towards the bottom of the listing page for the place you want to reserve. For some places, hosts offer a choice—non-refundable or refundable—each with a different price and set of terms.

		You’ll also be able to review the cancellation policy again before you book. After you book, you’ll see the details in the reservation confirmation email and on your Trips page.
